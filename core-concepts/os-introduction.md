## What is an operating system?

- A system software that works **as an interface between hardware components and end-user**.

## Core components of an OS

- Hardware
- Kernel
- Shell

### Hardware

- Motherboard
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- RAM
- Hard Disk Drive
- Solid State Drive
- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
- Power Supply Unit
- and many more

### Kernel

- The kernel **_manages resources of the computer_**, such as memory, processors, and file systems. It provides an abstraction layer that shields apps from the complexities of the underlying hardware, which allows software to run efficiently.
- The kernel is responsible for tasks like **scheduling processes**, **managing memory**, and **enforcing security policies**. It is the **_first program that runs when a computer starts up_** and remains in memory throughout the systemâ€™s operations.
- Different operating systems have different kernel designs, such as the **_Linux kernel_**,**_Windows kernel_** and **_macOS kernel_**. The kernel plays a crucial role in maintaining stability, security, and overall functionality of the operating system.

### Shell

- This is the user interface that interacts with the kernel, which in turn, interacts with the underlying hardware.
- It is a **_command line interface (CLI)_** or a **_graphical user interface (GUI)_** through which users can communicate with the computer and execute various commands and programs.
- The shell interprets commands entered by the user and sends instructions to the OS to perform tasks. It provides features like scripting, exploring and writing to a file system, automation and process management.
- Examples of popular shells include **Bash (Bourne Again SHell)**, **PowerShell**, and **Zsh**.
